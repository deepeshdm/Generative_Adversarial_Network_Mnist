# Generative_Adversarial_Network_Mnist
DCGAN trained on Mnist Dataset.In this Implementation I have used "Resize-Convolution" inplace of Deconvolution (Transposed Convolution) to upsample Images in the Generator to avoid the "Checkerboard" artifacts.

NOTE : (DCGAN_MNIST.zip is a zip file that contains the Ipython notebook with the model outputs at each Iteration during training)

Images Generated by Model after 15000 Iterations :
